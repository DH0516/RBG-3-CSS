    The Angler Fish also known as Incidental 211 is an unnamed red angler fish, 
    who apparently lives in Rock Bottom and appeared in the episode of the same name. <br> 
    Unlike all of the other residents of Rock Bottom, 
    he doesn't talk with a tongue accent. 
    Although, he is heard blowing raspberries with his tongue.
